# Meme Generator
Meme Generator is the capstone project created on Scrimba to show the knowledge gained from learning the React framework. 

## Getting Started (on Windows)

If you're using npm, run npm start in the windows command prompt. Make sure that you are currently located inside the folder of the cloned repository you have locally in your PC. 

The npm version I am using to run this project is 6.14.5.

```bash
npm -v
6.14.5
```

If you do not have npm, visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the latest version for Node.js. 

Afterwards, you will want to make sure you are currently located in the same directory as the file "package.json" is located and run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

This may take several minutes. Once it is finished, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This should open up a tab on your default browser that will show the react app running on a local server. 

### Still not working?

Please visit the following repo https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages where there is a very in-depth README section that will help you run the react app here. 

### Netlify 

Here is a link to the React app on this repo deployed in netlify: https://m3m3g3n3rator.netlify.app/

### Reference
This project as mentioned earlier was given by the lovely people at Scrimba. Here is a direct link to the video they have providing the prompt and the code.

If you're completely new to the React framework like I am, I would recommend you enroll in the FREE course given by Bob Ziroll to help you learn React.

Thanks again to Bob Ziroll for providing the free online course, and to the rest of the people at Scrimba.
